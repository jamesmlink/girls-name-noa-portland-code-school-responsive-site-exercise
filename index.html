            Yep, that’s right.  <a href="http://nameberry.com/babyname/Noa">Noa is a girl’s name</a> through and through.  Add an H, however and now we’re venturing into solid male territory.  The boy’s name Noah (with an H) is actually the number 1 baby boy name in the U.S. as of 2015.  Noa (without an H) on the other hand, is just barely in the top 1,000 names for girls in the U.S, but it is still very much in female territory.  Not that there is anything wrong with crossing the gender lines; like Rebirth says, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMiZ-AStkO4">Do Whatcha Wanna</a>.  The point is just that Noa is conventionally a name given to girls, not boys.  And don’t be mistaken, Noa is not just a derivative of its male counterpart, it is a separate name with a separate meaning and history altogether.

          </div>
          <p>
            Noa is a less common name in the U.S. than it is in some other countries.  Israel in particular loves the name Noa, as it has ranked the number 1 name for baby girls for a decade.  It also ranks high in The Netherlands (#8), Spain (#25), and Belguim (#58).  And while less popular in North America, it ranks at #485 in Canada and just recently broke the top 1,000 here in the U.S.

          <h2>Fact 3: Feminist Biblical Origins</h2>
            <div class="article_image">
              <img class="artfeature" src="img/lavender_small_size.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
          <p>
            Noa is a Hebrew name from the Old.  She was a daughter of Zelophehad and had four sisters.  They were coming of age in during the time of Moses and the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt, which would be somewhere around 1440 BC.  Apparently what happened is that Moses promised the male patriarchs land when they returned to the promise land, and if there was no male patriarch alive, the land would go to the oldest male.
          </p>
          <p>
            This created a problem for Noa and her sisters when their father died.  So they petitioned Moses, priests, chieftains, and the entire assembly to have the land right passed on to them in the name of fairness.  Their request was granted, earning them some serious feminist street cred.

          </div>
          <p>
            In Hebrew, Noa means movement or motion.  In Japan, the name means my love or from love.  In Hawaii, the name is associated with freedom, which is very similar to the meaning of the word noa in Maori cultures.  Even the authoritative source <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=noa">Urban Dictionary</a> has some positive, albeit somewhat superficial, things to say on the matter.

          <h2>Fact 5: Gender Confusion Not Necessarily A Bad Thing</h2>
          <div class="article_image">

          </div>

            One big concern parents might have when considering the name Noa for a girl is gender confusion.  After all, Noah is the most common name for boys in the U.S. right now.  But I’d argue that the inevitable gender confusion and even occasional teasing might not be such a bad thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, to address the gender confusion.  Being mistaken for a guy on paper might actually help Noas sidestep structural gender discrimination.  One would hope that in 20 plus years this isn’t the case, but a gender neutral name is still good insurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            And second, about the teasing… Research shows that kids with more unusual names, names likely to trigger teasing and head-scratching, actually end up developing more robust coping / compensation mechanisms than their more traditionally-named peers.  Having a less common name effectively gives kids a step up in the world by challenging them to find ways to overcome the added burdens a different name might sometimes bring.

            For parents that want avoid abbreviated nicknames (Mike instead of Michael, for example), it doesn’t get much shorter than Noa.

          </div>
          <p>
            Naming in the U.S. right now is about uniqueness (we all want to be special and have special kids).  Noa fits the bill there.  Additionally, <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/06/soon-all-babies-will-have-gender-neutral-names.html">gender-neutral names are becoming quite the trend too</a>.  Noa isn’t exactly a gender-neutral name (as we talked about above), but it sounds like one, which is sort of the best of both worlds.  And lastly, short names for girls like Ava or Lily are very trendy right now too.  Personally, I’m not a big fan of trying to anticipate what the Joneses are naming their baby, but knowing that the name Noa won’t be that out of place is sort of reassuring.

            Last, but certainly not least, the name Noa is just a really nice name, imho.  It makes me think of a certain type of girl, a certain type of person.  It looks nice on paper, is easy to spell, and works well with long last middle names.  As a name, it is strong, pretty, unassuming, noble, playful, etc.  All in all, Noa is a great name, one that my wife and I will likely choose for our daughter.
